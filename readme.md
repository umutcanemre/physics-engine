# My Particle Physics Library

#### Why I made this

This was my Grade 11 Computer Science final project. My personal goals with
this project were to learn how to use object oriented programming to make
highly modular and easily expanded libraries. In addition, I wanted to learn
about graphics rendering and using WebGL and develop my skills in producing code that
was readable and organized enough thatothers could use it.

There is lots of room for further development, optimization and redesign! This is 
as far as I got in the time given to complete the project in my class.

#### Functionality
Demos of the functionality of the library can be found in the "demos.html" html file.

So far, what can you do with this library?

-Create a canvas, fill it with particles of varying size, mass, and colour
-Place attractions throughout the canvas that particles will tend towards
-Make particles collide with one another (WIP)

All calculations and integration for particle motion and behaviours
are  based on the forces being experienced by particles at any
given time. This means that this library can easily be expanded to
include new behaviours, such as charge based attraction, angular velocity,
and more.
