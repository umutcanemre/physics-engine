# Particle Physics Enginer

#### Functionality
Demos of the functionality of the library can be found in the "demos.html" html file.

What can you do with this engine?

-Create a canvas, fill it with particles of varying size, mass, and colour

-Place attractions throughout the canvas that particles will linearly accelerate towards

-Impulse based Interparticle Collision (WIP)

-Linear boundaries supporting impulse based particle collisions

Features

-Verlet integration of position

-Modular codebase, new interparticle or global behaviours can be added with ease (non-linear friction, interparticle interactions, interparticle friction etc.)

-Only JS
