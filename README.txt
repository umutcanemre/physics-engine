Demos of the functionality of the library can be found in
the "demos.html" html file, simply open in browser and view.
Since creating demos was not the primary goal of the project
it does not necessarily contain the many things that could be
built using the library, simply demonstrations of the core functions.

The library is functional and can be used to add some simple physics
to webpages. Of course, with lots of room for further development,
optimization and redesign. Unfortunately I do not have a central
documentation of the code as this was not really a main focus of
the project either. However, if you would like to try out making
your own cool physics things, simply refer to the demo files
in /demos to see how things are structured and how to do things with
this library. All files containing code for the library are thoroughly
commented as well, so its not too difficult to learn how to use the
library, albeit, not too convienient either.

The "index.html" file was used primarily for testing features and
debugging as the library was developed. The scripts in that file
can also be reviewed for insight into the library though it is very
messy and not well commented at all. 

Questions, concerns, bugs, comments and any other communications regarding
the library can be addressed to "umute1@educbe.ca"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project is not necessarily the completed library but
as far as I could get in the time given.

The time spent on learning the physics and webgl proved to be the
greatest time sinks, but nontheless I have made what I would consider
to be the core of a physics library. New features can simply be piled
on.

*Collision requires some tweaking and debugging, but for simple
visual purposes likely suffices.
